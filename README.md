# Harmony-Search-algorithm
Harmony Search is a metaheuristic algorithm that is inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. It is used for solving optimization problems, such as finding the global minimum or maximum of a function. The algorithm simulates the improvisation process by generating a set of "harmonies" (i.e., potential solutions) and iteratively improving them based on a set of rules.
